# Y3k-8 
### v0.0.2

Name is placeholder. This is an 8 bit emulator. All programs will be made in my own assembly. It will probably borrow ideas from assembly and other emulators I have seen. 

Atm I am working on cleaning this speghetti fuck fest I have created.

I will eventually make a custom C like language for the emulator, then make an OS with it.

## Compiling

Just compile `main.c`.

## Usage

`./out "filename"`

Check the docs and `tests/` to look at the assembly instructions that are currently supported.
When you run the program, you will see the lexer and parser output. And then you will see the
values inside the registers.

Open an issue if its a bug or a feature or something else before you choose to work on it because it is possible I am aware / working on it.

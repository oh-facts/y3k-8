# Y3k-8

Name is placeholder. This is an 8 bit emulator. I am currently working on the assembler. All programs will be made in my own assembly. It will probably borrow ideas from assembly and other emulators I have seen. 

I will eventually make a custom C like language for the emulator, then make an OS with it.
